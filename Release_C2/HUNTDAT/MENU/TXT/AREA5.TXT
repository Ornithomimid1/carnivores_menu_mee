Mount Ravan

This island, broken by waterways and 
mountains is the most difficult by far.
The frozen peaks of Mt. Ravan overlook 
a thick tropical forest that may quickly 
become a deadly maze where hidden danger 
abounds. Be careful of the active lavaflow 
to the south as well. 

Advanced difficulty.
